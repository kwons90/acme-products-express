## Note

Do not worry about this file. `html-webpack-plugin` uses this file to generate the `index.html` that is served when we build the src code using `webpack`. In all likelihood, you should never need to touch this.

Exceptions to that are essentially you adding a CDN link. I already include some google fonts.
